## Observations
- The match was decided early: the opponent scored six goals in the first 20 minutes (up to 19'), creating a large deficit that USAO struggled to overcome.
- Defensive organisation and transitions appear to be the main weaknesses: the timeline and notes mention coordinated opponent play (well-executed set-piece/corner combinations) and repeated vulnerabilities when defending in numbers.
- Positive signs: USAO showed finishing ability in bursts (Nestor, Tiago, Nathan all scored) and some individual strengths — Nathan good in 1v1s, Nestor and Tiago effective on set pieces.
- Goalkeeper performance: Louis Burgraff recorded multiple saves early on, which limited the margin of defeat; however the defence allowed a high volume of clear chances.

## Player highlights
- Nestor Arnould: 2 goals (22', 49'), 1 off-target (33'). Shows finishing and involvement in decisive moments; got visibly frustrated according to coach notes — consider confidence management.
- Tiago Wauthia: 1 goal (34'), noted as effective on free kicks but positioned low in attack in the first period; tactical repositioning may help.
- Nathan Blyweert Doumont: 1 goal (40'), effective on 1v1s on the counter.
- Maxence Jonckheere: contributed an off-target shot (36'); noted as slightly slow in transition.

## Defensive issues to address (coaching focus)
1. Transition defence: opponents scored many goals from quick combinations and transitions. Practice rapid recovery runs and compact zones after turnovers.
2. Set-piece defence: opponent corners/short combinations produced goals. Drill coordinated marking and zonal/near-post coverage on corners.
3. Communication & positioning: repeated concessions indicate gaps in marking and positional discipline (especially in early phase).

## Training recommendations (short-term)
1. Two-session plan: one defensive session (shape, transition, set-piece defending), one finishing session (reduce rushes, composure around goal).
2. Small-sided drills (3v3 → 5v5) with immediate transition constraints (after a turnover the defenders must recover to a line), to rehearse recovery and pressing triggers.
3. Set-piece routines: practice defend/clear responsibilities and quick counter-release for free kicks and corners.
4. Confidence & role clarity: brief 1:1 with Nestor and Tiago to explain roles in attack and calm game plans to reduce frustration and stress.

## Suggested next steps
1. Review full video (if available) of the match to tag the unknown opponent scorers and verify unrecorded shots.
2. Integrate these highlights into the next training plan (add drills: defensive transitions, set-piece defending).
3. Track the same metrics across next 3 matches to measure improvement (goals conceded during first 20', set-piece goals conceded, successful recovery runs).
